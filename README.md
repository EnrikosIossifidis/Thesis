# Thesis 'Analyzing synergistic random variables from the jointpdf and syndisc package using permutation groups.'

## Steps for comparison between found and constructed SRVs

#### Step 0: Generate random 2D plane of SRV cost landscape. Understanding where to find SRVs.

#### Step 1: Find and save SRVs using the jointpdf and syndisc package. 

#### Step 2: Generate and save (lower-order) sudoku SRVs

#### Step 3: Compare each found SRV to each (lower-order) sudoku
